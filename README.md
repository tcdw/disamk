Disassemble SPC generated by AddmusicK 1.0.x (Other versions such as AddmusicK 1.1.x Beta are **unsupported!**)

## FAQ

### Why the output txt has no line breaks?

You probably opened with Windows 7 or older versions of Windows 10's Notepad, which isn't supporting UNIX line breaking.

You can try open the generated txt file with other text editors, such as Sublime Text and Kate.

## Why this tool exists?

The main reason I made this is letting people recovering the source file from a single SPC, or learning porting tricks from SPCs released in SMWC Idol/Super Famicompo/etc.
